# Strava Report Generator

A serverless application using python3, Dynamo DB, AWS Secrets Manager, SNS & S3

Uses activity data from Strava APIs to generate reports for an athlete
Uses access tokens to authorize access to the APIs
Runs on a schedule (every hour? TBD) to pull down the latest activities and store them in a DDB table
All reports are generated from data held in DDB
Any new activities cause the reports to be re-generated
Reports are published to a public S3 bucket for presentation

Uses docker to build packages compatible with Lambda service

### Cron expressions syntax

```pseudo
cron(Minutes Hours Day-of-month Month Day-of-week Year)
```

All fields are required and time zone is UTC only.

| Field         | Values         | Wildcards     |
| ------------- |:--------------:|:-------------:|
| Minutes       | 0-59           | , - * /       |
| Hours         | 0-23           | , - * /       |
| Day-of-month  | 1-31           | , - * ? / L W |
| Month         | 1-12 or JAN-DEC| , - * /       |
| Day-of-week   | 1-7 or SUN-SAT | , - * ? / L # |
| Year          | 192199      | , - * /       |

In below example, we use `cron` syntax to define `schedule` event that will trigger our `cronHandler` function every second minute every Monday through Friday

```yml
functions:
  cronHandler:
    handler: handler.run
    events:
      - schedule: cron(0/2 * ? * MON-FRI *)
```

Detailed information about cron expressions in available in official [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html#CronExpressions).


## Usage

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

After running deploy, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-python-scheduled-cron-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

✔ Service deployed to stack aws-python-scheduled-cron-project-dev (205s)

functions:
  rateHandler: aws-python-scheduled-cron-project-dev-rateHandler (2.9 kB)
  cronHandler: aws-python-scheduled-cron-project-dev-cronHandler (2.9 kB)
```

There is no additional step required. Your defined schedules becomes active right away after deployment.

### Local invocation

In order to test out your functions locally, you can invoke them with the following command:

```
serverless invoke local --function rateHandler
```

After invocation, you should see output similar to:

```bash
INFO:handler:Your cron function aws-python-scheduled-cron-dev-rateHandler ran at 15:02:43.203145
```

### Bundling dependencies

In case you would like to include 3rd party dependencies, you will need to use a plugin called `serverless-python-requirements`. You can set it up by running the following command:

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Running the above will automatically add `serverless-python-requirements` to `plugins` section in your `serverless.yml` file and add it as a `devDependency` to `package.json` file. The `package.json` file will be automatically created if it doesn't exist beforehand. Now you will be able to add your dependencies to `requirements.txt` file (`Pipfile` and `pyproject.toml` is also supported but requires additional configuration) and they will be automatically injected to Lambda package during build process. For more details about the plugin's configuration, please refer to [official documentation](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).
